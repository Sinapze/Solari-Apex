# Solari-Apex
The repository for my first major mod: Solari Apex

Please note that this is an unreleased mod and is majorly a work in progress.
Nothing is guaranteed to work, be stable, or continue to exist in future versions.

Code is heavily commented as I am a beginner mod maker and it helps to have comments to remind myself what stuff does at a glance
Feel free to look at, use, change or otherwise utilize the code here, thats why it is open source in the first place.
However, if anything major is borrowed or directly copied (not just methods of doing something), please include credit somewhere.
